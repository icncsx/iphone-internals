              In fact, the company neither manufactures nor assembles the
              components into the finished products we see on display. The parts
              come from a variety of suppliers and the assembly is ultimately
              carried out by Foxconn, a Taiwanese company.

              Chances are, these facts are not very surprising to you, the
              astute iPhone user who noted the following discretely inscribed on
              the back: "Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China."

              On the other hand, if Apple’s vast supply chain perplexes you,
              maybe it's because you haven’t seen the internals of a smartphone.
              Hint: it's pretty elaborate . To help you visualize this, I'm
              going to use images from this Bloomberg

                3. Africa, South America and Oceania play a very small role.
                There may be an explanation for this (see immediately below).
              </li>
              <li>
                4. Raw materials producers from Africa, South America and
                Oceania are noticeably absent. Apple seems to only include firms
                which are involved in the intermediate product and process.
              </li>

              <li>
                6. Apple does involve a fair number of U.S. suppliers, most

              </li>
              <li>
                7. Each address does not represent a unique supplier. A single
                company may have multiple divisons/offices which contribute
                differently. Samsung is represented more than ten times in this
                map through its many global subsidiaries and offices.

              did companies with foreign names like Foxconn and Kyocera get
              involved? The answer? Scale. In terms of units sold, the iPhone is
              the most successful consumer product ever created. More than 1.2
              billion iPhones and 15 distinct models have been sold since
              January 2007. For Apple, producing devices in the hundreds of
              millions annually required answering many technical and economic
              questions.
              <span class="emphasis">
                The good answers, almost every time, were founded by a global

              Though components differ between versions, modern iPhones contain
              nearly 500 parts, an estimated 90 percent of which are
              manufactured and assembled outside of the United States. Advanced
              semiconductors have come typically come from Germany and the U.S.,
              memory from Korea and Japan, display panels and circuitry from
              Korea and Taiwan and raw materials from Africa and South America.
              And everything is put together in Shenzhen, China and finally
              distributed to their ultimate destinations over the seas by
              several 200,000 ton transport vessels operated by a
              Danish-operated but Japanese financed container shipping company.
              If that isn't one of the most complete representations of modern
              international trade and economic growth, I don't know what is.

            <p class="footnote">
              Scraping a PDF document is a notoriously difficult job. For this
              piece, I used a Java program called Tabula to accurately parse any
              tables in Apple's Supply Chain document. With those addresses in a
              neat CSV file, I used Google's Geocoding API to derive the lat lon
              coordinates. To ensure their accuracy, I plotted each lat lon
              coordinate on a map to see if they returned accurately.

              me, and I would like to thank them for their crisp images of each
              iPhone component that are the foundations for my own piece.
